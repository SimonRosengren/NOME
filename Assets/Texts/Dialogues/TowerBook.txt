I don't know how long I have been living in this tower. Maybe 2 months? I have been surviving on berries and diseased animals, but yesterday I almost scored myself a freshly killed deer! Sadly, I had to leave it behind because I almost got spotted by one of the searchers. My instincts tell me not to go back there, but the thought of fresh meat is just too tempting. They can't be smart enough to sit by the deer and wait for me right?
